# Comments of Boolean Logic
It takes me a quite long time to understand the Boolean Logic in Python.
But it really helps when I tried to understand it as a maths topic.

A=1 
B=0
C=1

A+B=1+0=1
A+C=1+1=1
A*B=1*0=0
A*B=1*1=1


# Number Game (can be divided by 7 but should not be multiples of 5)
list2=[]
for i in range (1000,2000)
  if i%7=0 and i%5!=0
        list2.append(stir(i))
Print(",".join(list2))

# Comments- the useage of !
I found this funny coding online and have a question in here the meaning of usage "!" in coding.
"!" means not in C language

# comments: Easy coding but a thinking is whether it is necessaryï¼Ÿ Coding should not a barrier for easy life, haha right?
